## Khabiri Chatbot

"Khabiri" is an AI powered chatbot designed to streamline and enhance interactions with financial data patrticularly the intricate nature of the balance sheet and the accounting documents. Navigating through the complication of the numbers and ensuring accuracy in documents demands considerable time and expertise, which place stress on financial teams. that's why I created this cutting-edge solution that transforms the way we engage with finance related information and help accountants in generating the necessary documents for financial operations.
Khabiri Chatbot is powered by the GPT3.5 turbo language model. this advanced virtual assistant is the result of finetuning where I have adapted the capabalities of GPT3.5 turbo to specifically answer the domain of finance.
I already work on this chatbot and the GnAI Hackathon was a great opportunity to accelerate the work and get ready for test .
